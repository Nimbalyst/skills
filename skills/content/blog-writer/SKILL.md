# Blog

Write, edit, or update blog posts for the Nimbalyst marketing site. Create content that is direct, practical, and positions Nimbalyst as a thought leader in AI-assisted development and markdown editing.

## File Location and Naming

**Location**: `nimbalyst-local/Marketing/New Blogs/[name].md`

**Completed blogs**: Move to `nimbalyst-local/Marketing/New Blogs/Done/` when finalized

**Naming conventions**:
- Use kebab-case slug: `complete-guide-markdown-editors-2025.md`
- Be descriptive: The filename should indicate the topic clearly
- Example: `ai-code-generation-best-practices.md`

## Writing Style

Your blogs should follow this distinctive voice:

### Tone
- **Direct and confident**: Make clear statements. Avoid hedging language like "might", "perhaps", "could potentially"
- **Practical over theoretical**: Focus on what readers can do, not abstract concepts
- **Conversational but professional**: Like explaining to a smart colleague
- **No fluff**: Every sentence should add value. Cut unnecessary words

### Structure
- **Strong opening hook**: State the problem or insight immediately. No warm-up paragraphs
- **Short paragraphs**: 1-4 sentences max. White space aids readability
- **Strategic bold text**: Highlight key points, not for emphasis everywhere
- **Bullet lists for scannable content**: Use sparingly for lists of 3+ items
- **Tables for comparisons**: Feature comparisons, tool comparisons, etc.

### What to Avoid
- Emojis (never use them)
- Exclamation points (rarely, if ever)
- Marketing superlatives ("amazing", "revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Vague claims without specifics
- Long introductions before getting to the point
- Overly enthusiastic language

## Blog Template

```markdown
# [Title: Clear, Specific, Often Includes Year for SEO]

## [Opening Section - No "Introduction" Header]

[1-2 paragraphs that hook the reader with the core insight or problem. Get to the point immediately.]

## [Main Sections]

[Break content into logical sections. Each section should stand alone and provide value.]

### Subsections When Needed

[Use H3 for subsections within main topics]

## [Comparison Tables When Relevant]

| Feature | Tool A | Tool B | Nimbalyst |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Feature 1] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |

## [Practical Workflows or How-To Sections]

Step-by-step content with code blocks when relevant:

```bash
example command
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### [Question that readers actually search for?]

[Direct answer, 2-4 sentences. Reference Nimbalyst naturally where relevant.]

### [Another common question?]

[Answer]

## Conclusion

[2-3 sentences wrapping up. No "In conclusion" opener. End with a clear takeaway or call to action.]
```

- **What problem does this solve?** What will readers learn or be able to do?
- **What's the unique angle?** Why would someone read this over other content on the topic?
- **Where does Nimbalyst fit?** Naturally, or is this pure thought leadership?
